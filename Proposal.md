# Notely

## Description and Motivation

Notely will be a platform for users to create, play, and share piano music with others.
My motivation for this project comes from when Seth and I made muscially. 
When we were adding default music for the ghost play, we toyed with the idea of letting users add their own music. 
We couldn't get it implemented due to time and the lack of a back-end framework. 
However, now we have a back-end framework with spring.

## Prior Art

This project will take inspiration from muscially, Seth and I's JavaScript Unit Project. The piano and ghost play will be extracted and brought over.
Another website, virtualpiano.net, has something similar, with users being able to add music sheets to a library.

## Core User Workflow 

- The user will first land on the welcome page, which will prompt the user to log in.
- After logging in, the user will be brought to the keyboard piano and ghost play.
- There will be a link that users can click on to view all public music for ghost play.
- Users can save music that they create in ghost play. 
  They can choose for it to be public or private.
